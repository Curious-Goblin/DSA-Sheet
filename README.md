# Strivers' DSA Practice Repository

This Git repository contains my solutions to the questions from the [Strivers' A2Z DSA Course Sheet 2](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/). Each solution is accompanied by its time complexity (T.C.) and space complexity (S.C.) analysis. Additionally, I've provided optimal solutions where applicable.

## Introduction

In this repository, I've documented my journey through the Strivers' DSA practice sheet. The purpose is not only to solve the problems but also to analyze their efficiency and provide optimal solutions where possible.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for each problem.
- `analysis/`: Contains detailed time and space complexity analysis for each solution.
- `optimal-solutions/`: Contains optimal solutions, if available.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/strivers-dsa-practice.git
